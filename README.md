I am a software engineer currently living in Chicago. I worked at a trading firm for a few years right out of college, and now I write Haskell code for Bitnomial.

In the past I've made open source contributions to [rust-clippy](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-clippy/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Abradsherman) and [morpheus-graphql](https://github.com/morpheusgraphql/morpheus-graphql/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Abradsherman).

Check out my [website](https://bitsbybrad.com) for more information on what I'm currently doing!
